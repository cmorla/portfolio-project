                <p>Computing and information technology have enabled so many great things for humanity and we at AI of Color would be dismayed if we were seen as an entity to neglect or deny this. Our biggest wish is to help technology flourish and to foster discovery and innovation. The problem is we cannot do that while disadvantaged communities are oppressed and discriminated against by the same technologies that we know and love.</p>

                <p>The ubiquity, opacity, and complexity of algorithmic decision-making propelled the creation of this initiative. We do not assume that the impacts of algorithmic injustice and bias is a trending topic among those who are frequently impacted by unfair decision-making techniques. Furthermore, we at AI of Color have seen countless discussions, panels, and workshops dominated by those who contribute to or represent algorithmic injustice itself. We have seen how talking heads have drowned out important conversations, overtaking media headlines, academic conferences and more.</p>

            <div class = "text-section">
                <p>We know it can be difficult for non-technical stakeholders to identify when and how AI-based tools have been implemented or have led to erroneous or biased results. At AI of Color our mission is to equip impacted communities with the tools and information required to understand and question unfair practices resulting from algorithmic and machine learning techniques. We will also work to promote diversity and inclusion in the technical and policy dialogues relating to artificial intelligence.</p>
